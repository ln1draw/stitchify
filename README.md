# Stitchify

## Getting Started

`gem install stitchify`

`s = Stitchifier.new(URL, num_of_px, px_size, num_of_colors)`

this will create stitchify.svg if it does not already exist and populate it with svg data. To see the image, open this file.

Hi! This is my first real gem. I am aware that the documentation is lacking. I'm really tired, so I'm going to bed for now, but I'll get back to it!
